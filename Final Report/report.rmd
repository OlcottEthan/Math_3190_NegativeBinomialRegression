## Negative Binomial Distribution


## Negative Binomial Regression

Negative Binomial Regression is very similar to multiple regression but instead of assuming that the dependent variable is normal we assume that it follows a negative binomial distribution.

This method is typically used when the data is over-dispersed, IE: the variance of the observed results is higher than the variance the model predicted. It also can be used as a generalization of Poisson regression since the mean structure is the same and it also has an extra parameter to model the over-dispersion.

See that the Poisson distribution can be given as follows

$$\text{Poisson}(\lambda)=\lim_{r\to\infty}\text{NegativeBinomial}\Big(r,\frac{r}{r+\lambda}\Big)$$
